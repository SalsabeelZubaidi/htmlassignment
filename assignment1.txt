>> what's the difference between <p> and <article> ?
 - <p> creates a new paragraph.
 - <article> is basically only a container, alone it doesn't do anything, it just helps to keep the website organized.


>> what's the difference between <div> and <section> ?
 - <div> is a generic container element that does not carry any semantic meaning. It is mostly used for grouping related elements together
   and applying styling to them via CSS.

 - <section> is a semantic element that represents a specific section of a web page with a distinct topic or purpose, and it is often used 
   for dividing a page into multiple sections, like chapters in a book, to make it more organized and easier to understand for both humans  
   and machines.
